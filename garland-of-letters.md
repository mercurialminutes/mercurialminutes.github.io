From Lord Shivaâ€™s Tandava to the multidimensional vector space of Word Embeddings used in the state-of-the-art generative AI models, we witness the the divine essence of language. The dance of creation continues, inside the boney rigs of A100 industrial-grade GPUs into realms we are just beginning to imagine.
In this talk, we first look at the parallels between Sanskrit and Ancient Hebrew and the belief they are the basic building blocks of the universe. Then we try to conceptualise the creation process as a mixing of primal energies in multidimensional coordinate systems, and at the end, we look at the problem of word embeddings used to encode language in large language models such as GPT. What parallels can we find between the naming magick, sacred alphabets and computational intelligence?
