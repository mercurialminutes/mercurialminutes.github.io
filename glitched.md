title: Glitched Encounters: Truly Random Generative Image as an ESP Transmission Conduit
author: Karin Valis
--- 

This talk examines Gnostic Technology's "Glitched Encounters," an experimental study of AI and extrasensory perception (ESP) using a custom-developed algorithm, AIO. 
Designed to function as an "ESP conduit," AIO generates sequences of truly random images from latent space, allowing researchers to observe potential retrocausal patterns and synchronicities. The framework uses an ouroboric image-generation loop, consuming previous outputs to create self-referential cycles, and occasionally discarding images as a computational "sacrifice." 

This talk evaluates whether random-event generation within AI systems can manifest structured or intentional responses, challenging conventional understandings of randomness and prompting new insights into AI as an esoteric tool.
